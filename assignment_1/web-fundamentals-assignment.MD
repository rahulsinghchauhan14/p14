Q1: What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?
``
A protocol stack, often referred to as a network stack, is a set of standardized protocols that work together to enable communication between different software applications or components within a networked system.

Each layer of the stack provides specific functionality and services, and the combination of these layers forms a complete communication system.

In web development, the most commonly used protocol stack is the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) stack. The TCP/IP stack consists of several layers, each serving a specific purpose.

1. Physical Layer: Deals with the physical connection between devices and the transmission of raw binary data over a physical medium (e.g., cables, wireless signals).

2. Data Link Layer: Manages the communication between directly connected devices on the same network. It is responsible for creating a reliabe link between nodes, often through the use of MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.

3. Network Layer: Handles the routing of data between different networks. The Internet Protocol (IP) operates at this layer, providing logical addressing and facilitating the transfer of data between devices on different networks.

4. Transport Layer: Manages end-to-end communication, ensuring the reliable and ordered delivery of data. TCP operates at this layer and is connection-oriented, providing features like error checking, flow control, and retransmission of lost pockets.

5. Session Layer: Manages sessions or connections between applications on different devices. It establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions, allowing for synchronization and organization of data exchange.

6. Presentation Layer: Deals with data format translation, ensuring that data is presented in a readable format for both the sender and receiver. It may involve encryption and compression.

7. Application Layer: Provides network services directly to end-users or applications. It includes various protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP and others.

When you access a new website, your browser may need to make a DNS request:

Application Layer: DNS
Transport Layer: UDP
Network Layer: IP (v4)
Link Layer: Ethernet or Wireless LAN
If the website uses HTTPS, the protocol stack includes multiple layers at the application level (both HTTP and TLS):

Application Layer: HTTP and TLS
Transport Layer: TCP
Network Layer: IP (v4)
Link Layer: Ethernet or Wireless LAN

Q2: What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?
``
A web server is like a computer program that stores and shares website files. When you visit a website, your browser talks to the web server, and the server sends back the webpage for you to see. It handles requests, generates responses, and makes sure information is sent securely. Popular web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.

### Apache HTTP Server:

- Functionality: Supports a wide range of features, including server-side scripting and URL redirection.
- Performance: Generally reliable, highly configurable, and capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.

### Nginx (pronounced "engine-x"):

- Functionality: Known for high performance, often used as a reverse proxy server and for load balancing. Excels at serving static content.
- Performance: Efficient in handling a large number of concurrent connections, making it popular for high-traffic websites.

### Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS):

- Functionality: Developed by Microsoft, integrates well with Microsoft technologies, supports ASP.NET for server-side scripting.
- Performance: Performs well on Windows-based systems, especially with Microsoft technologies.

### Node.js (with Express, Koa, etc.):

- Functionality: While not a traditional web server, Node.js allows building web servers using JavaScript. Frameworks like Express provide additional functionality.
- Performance: Non-blocking, event-driven architecture suitable for handling a large number of concurrent connections.

### Tomcat (Apache Tomcat):

- Functionality: Primarily used for deploying Java-based web applications, implements Java Servlet and JSP specifications.
- Performance: Well-suited for Java applications, provides a robust environment for running Java web applications.
