    <!-- First Paragraph -->
    <p>
        I'm Nobody! Who are you?

        Are you - Nobody - Too?

        Then there's a pair of us!

        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph -->
    <p>
        How dreary - to be - Somebody!

        How public - like a Frog -

        To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!
    </p>
    <!-- Third Paragraph -->

        By Emily Dickinson (1891)
